    <h2>Kelly the Cat</h2>
    <img src="Kelly the cat2.jpg">
    <p>It is a 2 year old female cat,with a mixture of dark-brown and black color.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things Kelly the cat likes doing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cudding and prawling</li>
        <li>Very playful</li>
        <li>Sleeping during the day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It likes  the following foods:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Hunting rodents like:
            <ul>
                <li>mice</li>
                <li>rats</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lungs</li>
        <li>Fish</li>
    </ol>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#a dog">A dog</a></li>
            <li><a href="#a play date calender">A play date calender</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about me">About me</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>I on the other side like watching how Kelly the cat plays and drinks milk.
        Its behaviour is unique in that it is always active during the night and sleepy 
        during the day.
        It is obedient and knows its owner.Kelly the cat likes playing with strings and 
        chasing after moving items which makes it more active.
        Cats have a very good instincts for hunting and great survival skills whichmakes them
       good predators.
